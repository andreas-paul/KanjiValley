# KANJI VALLEY

A Godot app to study Japanese Kanji, developed as part of my efforts to learn Godot and GameDev in general. Uses GDscript but for the Romaji to Kana conversion.

Features:

- JLPT5 Kanji only (for now)
- Check translation and reading
- Automatically converts to Hiragana while typing (in reading scene)

To do:

- Ability to select from all JLPT levels
- Switch between Hiragana and Katakana
- Save and load configuration and settings
- Hints if answer is wrong multiple times in succession
- Kanji history on a grid
- Maybe some sort of SRS
- More info about specific Kanji (maybe even Jiso.org integration)

Requirements:  

- Assets folder:

    - kanji.json downloaded from [here](https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data) 
    - Fonts (change to our own in editor for now)
